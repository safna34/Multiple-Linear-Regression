## Multiple Linear Regression Model for Determining Highway Mileage

### Overview
This Jupyter Notebook implements a multiple linear regression model to predict highway mileage (MPG) based on various vehicle features. The dataset undergoes extensive preprocessing, feature selection, and regression analysis to determine the most significant factors affecting highway mileage.

### Steps Included
1. **Load the dataset**:
   - Import the dataset from a reliable source.
   - Inspect the data structure to understand its components.
   
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Renaming columns for better readability and consistency.
   - Identifying and removing unnecessary variables that do not contribute to the model's predictive power.
   - Eliminating duplicate values to maintain data integrity.
   - Handling missing values through appropriate imputation techniques.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Applying one-hot encoding to categorical variables to convert them into numerical representations for the model.
   - Checking Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to detect and eliminate multicollinear features that may distort the model’s accuracy.
   - Standardizing and normalizing numerical features to improve model convergence.
   
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing feature distributions and correlations using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
   - Analyzing key insights from the data to understand underlying patterns that influence highway mileage.

5. **Model Training**:
   - Splitting the dataset into training and test sets to evaluate model performance.
   - Implementing multiple linear regression to determine the impact of independent variables on highway mileage.
   - Fine-tuning model parameters for better accuracy and generalization.

6. **Evaluation**:
   - Calculating performance metrics such as R-squared (R²) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess the model’s effectiveness.
   - Conducting residual analysis to check for patterns and ensure assumptions of linear regression are met.
   - Comparing the model’s performance with alternative regression techniques if needed.

### Results
- **Feature Importance**:
  - The analysis identifies key features that significantly impact highway mileage, such as vehicle weight, hybrid status, and forward gear ratio.
- **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**:
  - The model eliminates highly collinear variables, ensuring better accuracy and stability.
- **Model Performance**:
  - **R-squared (R²)**: [Value from the notebook] - Indicates how well the model explains the variance in highway mileage.
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: [Value from the notebook] - Measures the model's average prediction error.
  - **Residual Distribution**: Evaluates whether the errors follow a normal distribution, ensuring model reliability.

### Dependencies
Before running the notebook, install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```
Ensure your Python environment is properly set up with Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

### Usage
To use this notebook:
1. Open Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
2. Load the provided dataset and execute the cells sequentially.
3. Analyze the results and modify parameters as needed to refine predictions.
4. Visualize model predictions and gain insights into the most influential features.

### Future Improvements
- Experiment with polynomial regression or interaction terms for better feature representation.
- Implement regularization techniques such as Ridge or Lasso regression to reduce overfitting.
- Incorporate additional datasets to improve generalizability.
- Develop a web-based interface to allow users to input vehicle features and predict highway mileage interactively.
